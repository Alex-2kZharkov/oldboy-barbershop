This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Working on a feature
- Select appropriate branch purpose from the list: `feature`, `fix`, `test`, or `release`
- Everytime you work on a feature, create remote branch that follows the next pattern: `tag/HNJ-id_short-description`. For example, for the ticket https://zhyldyzargynbaeva.atlassian.net/browse/HNJ-1 it will be: `feature/HNJ-1_initializing-Nextjs-project`
